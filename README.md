# Tableau-Project

In this project, I have worked with sample sales data to create an interactive sales performance dashboard using Tableau. The project involves loading and exploring data, building visualizations such as bar charts and top 10 rankings, applying interactive filters, and using calculated fields to summarize key business metrics. The final result is a clean, dynamic dashboard that provides clear insights into sales performance and can be used for business decision-making.
